/* 
'this' is an implicite parameter passed to function when a function is invoked. It refers to an object that's associated with the function
invocation. Often termed as function context. 

what this parameter points to isn't defined only by how and where the function is defined, but it also heavily influnced by how function is invoked.

/* 
- As as function - simple()
- As a method - ninja.simple() which ties the invocation to an object,

- As a contructor - new Ninja(), in Which a new object is brought into being
- via function's call and apply methods - simple.call(ninja) or simple.apply(ninja)

Look closely the getMyThis and getName are normal function.
